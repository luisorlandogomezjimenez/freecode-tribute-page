            <p class="bio">Hayao Miyazaki is one of Japan's greatest animation directors. The entertaining plots,
                compelling characters, and
                breathtaking animation in his films have earned him international renown from critics as well as public
                recognition
                within Japan. The Walt Disney Company's commitment to introduce the films to the rest of the world will
                let more people
                appreciate the high-quality works he has given the movie-going public.</p>
            <p class="bio">Hayao Miyazaki was born in Tôkyô on January 5, 1941. He started his career in 1963 as an
                animator at the studio Toei
                Douga studio, and was subsequently involved in many early classics of Japanese animation. From the
                beginning, he
                commanded attention with his incredible drawing ability and the seemingly endless stream of movie ideas
                he proposed.</p>
            <p class="bio">In 1971, he moved to the A Pro studio with Isao Takahata, then to Nippon Animation in 1973,
                where he was heavily
                involved in the World Masterpiece Theater TV animation series for the next five years. In 1978, he
                directed his first TV
                series, Mirai shônen Konan (1978) (Conan, The Boy in Future), then moved to Tôkyô Movie Shinsha in 1979
                to direct his
                first movie, the classic Lupin the Third: Castle of Cagliostro (1979). In 1984, he released Nausicaä of
                the Valley of
                the Wind (1984), based on the manga (comic) of the same title he had started two years before. The
                success of the film
                led to the establishment of a new animation studio, Studio Ghibli (Sutajio Jiburi), at which Miyazaki
                has since
                directed, written, and produced many other films with Takahata and, more recently, Toshio Suzuki. All of
                these films
                enjoyed critical and box office successes. In particular, Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke (1997) received
                the Japanese
                equivalent of the Academy Award for Best Film and was the highest-grossing (about USD$150 million)
                domestic film in
                Japan's history at the time of its release.</p>
